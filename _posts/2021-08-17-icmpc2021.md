description: "ICMPC/ESCOM 2021"
excerpt: "Our platform targets enhancing interdisciplinary discussions regarding music emotion annotation and analysis. We mean to expose our tool to the research community and receive feedback on how to improve it: selection of music, usability, interface design, and so on. Our algorithms can only be as good as our agreement, and we need to work collectively to understand it."

## Improving emotion annotation of music using citizen science (ICMPC/ESCOM 2021)

This work was made with Nicolás Gutiérrez-Páez, Lorenzo Porcaro, Aggelos Gkiokas, Perfecto Herrera and Emilia Gómez, and was funded by the [TROMPA EU project](https://trompamusic.eu/). It was presented in the 16th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition (ICMPC/ESCOM).

### Abstract

The annotation of emotions is a notably complex task for any type of data. Particularly, annotating emotions in music involves three challenges: a) annotators are usually not aware of the difference between perceived and induced emotions - perceived emotions are those recognized by the listener when interpreting musical properties, while induced emotions involve psycho-physiological responses to music, b) the task is highly demanding for annotators - gamification has been introduced for better engage and incentivise participants, and c) inherent subjectivity demands data reliability analysis - evaluation of datasets typically use internal consistency measures, while more recent content analysis methods have started to be deployed.

## Human-centered machine learning for music emotion recognition

After some months, I'm very happy to share that I successfully defended my PhD thesis at the MTG. First, I'd like to thank my supervisors: Emilia Gómez, Estefanía Cano, and Perfecto Herrera. 

I also had the great luck of having an aawesome evaluating committee: Blair Kaneshiro, Isabelle Hupont, and Arthur Flexer. 

You can find my complete thesis [here](https://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/675915#page=1). Unfortunately, we had some streaming issues (so there is no recording available) but you can find the complete slides in [this link]().

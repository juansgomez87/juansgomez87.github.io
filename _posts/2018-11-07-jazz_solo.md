### Jazz Solo Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks

This code contains a show case of the paper *"Jazz Solo Instrument Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks, Source Separation, and Transfer Learning"* that was accepted in the ISMIR 2018 conference. <br/>

The code contains wav examples and the trained ConvNets to plot segment- and clip-wise predictions of the instruments in the an audio mixture. <br/>

The model has been trained to recognize the following instruments: soprano saxophone (ss), alto saxophone (as), tenor saxophone (ts), clarinet (cl), trombone (tb), and trumpet (tp). <br/>
The audio contains 6 jazz solos:
- Ornette Coleman - Ramblin (as)
- Buddy DeFranco - Autumn Leaves (cl)
- John Coltrane - My Favorite Things (ss)
- Frank Rossolino - Moonlight in Vermont (tb)
- Lee Morgan - The Sidewinder (tp)
- Michael Brecker - African Skies (ts)

An example of a real-time implementation using of the neural network can be seen in this video:
